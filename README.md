# Matplotlib-Module-5-Challenge
For the Module 5 challenge, I received help and parts of my code from my tutor, TA's, and Ask BCS.

SUBMISSION
Review all the figures and tables that you generated in this assignment. Write at least three observations or inferences that can be made from the data. Include these observations at the top of your notebook.

 In the Bar and Pie Charts section of the module, I noticed differences in the amount of each drug regimen after generating the bar plot. As a result, Ramicane and Capomuline was the most common pharmaceutical drug used on the mice; whereas, Propriva was the least used drug on the mice. Additoinally, the pie chart that illustrated the percentage of male and female mice was close to about 50/50. Next, in the Quartiles, Outliers and Boxplots section, the box plot illustrated an interesting distrubution of the tumor volume for the treatment groups. According to the data that was generated, Ceftamin had the largest variace and outlier for the values above 87.67 compared to Ramicance, Infubinol, and Capomulin.The third observation I made was when I calculated the the correlation cofficient and the linear regression model. I found that the correlation between mouse weight and the average tumor volume is 0.84. Therefore, there is a positive correlation between the weight and size of the mouse and the overall size of the tumor volume.
